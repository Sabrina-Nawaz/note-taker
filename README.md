## Usage & Installation

  To use the program, you need to run the `npm i` command in the terminal to download all dependencies. In order for the server to automatically restart rather than having to do it manually, you can enter the `npm run server` for `nodemon` to run and to listen to the PORT. Lastly, for IDs to generate for new notes entered, you will need to install `uuid` by entering the command `npm install uuid`. Once this is done, you will open the index.html file which will bring you to a landing page. On the landing page, you click on "Get Started" to start making notes.
